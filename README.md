# Founding

---

**_Founding_** is a strategy game that is based on _founding_ an empire.

The core idea behind this game is simulating a world and economies in it, rather
than having hard codded rules that decide what happens. Thus, there shell be no
arbitrary limitation against creating or destroying any structure.

Initially this game was developed in **Java**. This version started in **C**,
and made me learn a lot. Now it continues in **C++**. Also there is going to be
scripting support through **JavaScript**.
